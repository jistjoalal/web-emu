## Notes / Todo

- permanent ROM storage
- delete ROM button

- perf issues with large history
- cap history size

  - possibly by detecting loops / halts ?

- hex/dec/ascii mode toggle
- n-bits mode toggle

- did adding speed controls slow down wider machines?
- canvas listeners should work w/ speed=0?

- move updateDisplay to display class
